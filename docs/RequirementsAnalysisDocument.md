Pleisure is a web platform that aims to connect parents with activities providers for their children.

### User Groups and corresponding operations
The users of the platform can belong to one of the following groups:

1. Anonymous users
2. Parents
3. Vendors
4. Administrators

Anonymous users have access to all the content of the platform. They can view, without the need to login, all the events that are available, with priority to those hosted near them (the user's location is automatically determined by his IP address). They can also apply filters, to limit the events displayed and adjust the search to their preferences.

Parents are the users that are logged in as such. They can perform all the actions that an Anonymous user can, plus they have access to a personal profile page where they can add information and photos, and can also buy credits (see [Monetization](#monetization)).

Vendors are the activity-events providers. They can perform all the actions that Anonymous users can too, and are also entitled to an organisation page, where they can add details about their bussiness. The details can be general information, address, photos. In this page there is also a section where all the events hosted by this particular vendor are listed.

Administrators are special users that can manage the other 3 types of users. They can block users and change their passwords.

Authentication of the users is performed via their passwords.
